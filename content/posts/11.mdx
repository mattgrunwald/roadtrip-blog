# Day 11

Took some final pictures of the Tetons and headed north to Yellowstone. Rainey and I were both sort ambivalent about the park, but it is beautiful here. It's cool seeing the steaming pools of water and bison! So many bison. Also SO many tourists. The Tetons had lots of people but not nearly as many. These people in Yellowstone are tourists and seem generally ill-equipped for walking around a state park. Lots of bad shoe choices and not a lot of self-awareness.

The road through Yellowstone is down to one lane through the most congested part of the park. We lucked out and made it through without having to wait. Also, Old "Faithful" goes off every 45 to 120 minutes. I'd like to see a little more punctuality before I call something faithful!

We camped inside the park in a nice spot for RVs. The people checking us in were talkers, which would be fine but there was a line of cars waiting behind us. Light rain in the late afternoon but we had time to char some hot dogs for dinner and walk around a little after. My ebook is on the fritz. I've been reading aloud Blood Meridian. It's morbid and gruesome but beautifully written, and the descriptions of the scenery kind of fit the western landscape we're in. It will more once we're in the desert.
