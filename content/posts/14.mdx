# Day 14

On to Thompson Falls. We first stopped at WalMart and a Love's to take showers. They're like $15 but they are pretty nice, especially when you've only had access to camp showers for two weeks. Montana is like Wyoming but with more mountains.

The way in to Thompson from the east goes through the Flathead reservation, and it is beautiful. There's a winding green river you follow for hours with mountains on either side.

Our friends Natalie and Nate live on a horse ranch just outside of town. Their two energetic hound dogs were perfect playmates for Junie, and all the dogs loved the chicken coop right next to the dog area.

Nate drove us all out to a waterfall nestled in the mountains about thirty minutes from the ranch.
