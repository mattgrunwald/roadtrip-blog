# Day 18

Got some work done this morning. It was the first time we used the Starlink for more than an hour or so. It worked out well and didn't drain our batteries too much. I don't think we've gone under 60% battery this whole trip. It helps that we're driving so much.

Onto the Craters of the Moon national monument. This is a place that was (geologically) recently covered in lava flows that made otherworldly fields of rock, cooked and preserved forests, and left a very alien looking landscape.

Our campsite is right in the middle of a lava field. I guess the first Americans in the area hurt their feet walking around the lava rocks. Writing this now I wish we had taken a tour to learn more about the geology of the area, but we couldn't leave Junie in the van alone. So it goes.

We found a campsite next to another Roadtrek! We didn't see the owners but hopefully we can meet the and commiserate about our vans for a while. Theirs has Utah plates and it's in great condition! No rust, no chipped paint, and the fiberglass is in great shape. Rainey and I are jealous.

We did a drive around the lava flows and there were several areas you could get out and hike around. One right by the side of the road was a the tallest hill or mountain around, and Rainey and I took turns climbing up it. It was not a fun climb! The top was worth it. You could see for miles, right up to the Rockies. I'll never get tired of watching weather roll in and out in this kind of landscape.

The pavement all through the park is grooved for some reason. It seems uniform and ubiquitous enough to be intentional. The result is it feels like your engine or tires are messed up the whole time you're driving.

I tried to make jiffy pop and burnt it. Twice. What a world.

We saw a cool trailer that was literally just a cargo trailer outfitted with a bed, sink, AC, etc. It looks like a way to save money and build things out the way you want! Something to consider for our next trip.
