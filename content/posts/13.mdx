# Day 13

Up early to beat the rain. We didn't want to get stuck amile down a dirt road! We made it to a Cracker Barrel in Missoula for the rest of the day and night. Cracker Barrels let RVers stay in their parking lots nationwide! The rain came down in sheets in the afternoon but we stayed dry in the van. Cracker Barrel has more than breakfast food, who knew? And it's not too bad.

We ate lunch and dinner at Cracker Barrel because we're heathens.
