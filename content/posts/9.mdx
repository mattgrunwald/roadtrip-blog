# Day 9

Rainey saw the moose again this morning. I've seen too many moose attacks on the internet so it scared the hell out of me. It was only 50 yards away!

Made it to Grand Teton National Park. Holy shit. the mountains are beautiful! We reserved a campsite in Colter Bay where it isn't supposed to rain for a couple of days. This will hopefully be our first time staying more than one night in a place. Lots of RVs, trailers, and dogs. There's a small grocery store and laundromat (thankfully) and more signs about bear sightings. Saw a poster for a hiker missing since this time of the year 2021. It's morbid but the notice was describing the man's clothes and accessories so someone could hopefully identify any remains.

On a lighter note, the gift shop here has a great kids section. I want to get my niece a Smokey the Bear hat (or something she won't outgrow in three days.) and Rainey and I are buying souvenirs for the second time on this trip. Why yes, we do need a fourth Nalgene. Enamel pins and stickers? Enchante.

Had a small camp fire and it was lights out at 10pm.
