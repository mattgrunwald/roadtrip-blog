# Day 4

I forgot what it was like to be cold. It's wonderful! Junie peed in the van, and I mean she _peed_. We need to understand that she takes time to do her business and she needs to understand she has less time to do it than at home.

My first day working on the road. Cell service was pretty good but I wanted to make sure my first meeting didn't have issues so I set up Starlink. That was a pain since I needed to update my account and their app isn't the best. Still better than the Renogy app.

Weather out here is unpredictable. A huge rain/thunder/hail storm that was supposed to miss us wound up heading right towards us. We had to haul ass north back to Wall. We got some light rain there but the boondocking sight was likely pulverized. I wouldn't want to to try the road out after a rain like that.

We found a Love's on the way to Rapid City and slept there. We ate Hardee's for dinner.
