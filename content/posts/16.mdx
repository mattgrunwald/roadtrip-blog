# Day 16

For our last day with Natalie and Nate we drove to the Ross Creek Cedars located in a state park near the Canadian border. We saw a bear! It ran right a cross the winding road leading into the park. We had all our dogs with us and no bear spray, but the park had lots of people and I would imagine the wildlife stays away during the day.

The cedars are indeed huge. It reminded Rainey of the Redwoods, if only on a smaller scale.

Afterwards we went to a food truck in Thompson Falls and had some pretty good burritos. It was nice to see our friends and get a break from driving.

Montana is cool but I guess the property values are as outrageous as most of the country right now. Guess it's just a place to visit.
