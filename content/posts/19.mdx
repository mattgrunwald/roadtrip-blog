# Day 19

On to Salt Lake City. The first two days in Idaho were beautiful, but now we left the mountains and drove through more boring grassland that slowly turned into desert. It was HOT today.

We put on the Napoleon Dynamite soundtrack, which was cozy. We also made a stop at the Idaho Potato Museum, although we didn't take a tour. I guess we're happy with our current knowledge of potato history.

We stopped for lunch at an In-N-Out burger, and it was alright. Just alright. The way people online talk about it you would think it was the best burger ever, but Rainey and I both agreed Five Guys was better in almost every way.

By the time we got to SLC traffic was pretty bad. We made it to a state park in Provo where the mosquitos are possibly the worst they've been since Illinois.

A storm rolled in and we watched a movie with the AC on. I'm more and more thankful every day that we left the AC in the back of the van. I'm even more glad we picked a campsite with shore power today. I did the math and I think with full battery and nothing else running we could run the AC for about four hours on eco mode. Not great.
