# Day 12

Drove out of Yellowstone and this place felt like a zoo. I saw a four year old not 20 yards form a full grown bison. A minivan stopped traffic to take a picture of an elk! This place is beautiful, but the people in this park by and large do not know how to behave in this setting. It's kind of scary.

We made it into Montana, then Idaho, then back into Montana and are camping in a valley near a lake a mile or so down a dirt road in a town called Ennis. People are friendly, but I'm worried about rain tonight and tomorrow making the road out of this camp site unfriendly. Luckily the reception here is much better than in Yellowstone.

We got lucky with the rain again and only had light showers. There was an (unleashed) dog by one of the vans in our campsite that was aggressive towards Junie (and Rainey and me) and the owners could hardly be bothered to deal with it. People.

On the other hand we saw two small moose 50 feet away from the van. Kind of scary and very cool!
