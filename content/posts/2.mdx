# Day 2

Another long driving day, another late start. Iowa looked like Ohio except the trees are shorter and more gnarled and the grass feels drier. It's pretty boring, but now I get why those guys in Slipknot are so angry.

Once we got to South Dakota our route took us through some serene country roads. We made it to a town that has a really nice public RV park. Again we were the only ones there. It's kind of creepy. I took the fastest shower of my life after sunset. The shore power hookup works though! It doesn't charge the batteries all the way but whatever.

Still swarms of mosquitos. But it's nice to run the AC at night.
