# Day 2

Another long driving day, another late start. Iowa looked like Ohio except the trees are shorter and more gnarled and the grass feels drier. Our route took us on some remote country/county roads and it was serene.

We made it to a town in South Dakota that has a really nice public RV park. Again we were the only ones there. It was kind of creepy. I took the fastest shower of my life after sunset. The shore power hookup works though! It doesn't charge the batteries all the way but whatever.

Still swarms of mosquitos. But it was nice to run the AC at night.
