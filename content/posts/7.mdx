# Day 7

Worked all day in Douglas and then drove to Shoshoni, a town just outside of the Wind River Reservation. We're staying at a remote and kind of creepy rest stop. Our only company is a trucker, but it's better than nothing. It rained a lot so there isn't much to do besides browse the internet and read.
