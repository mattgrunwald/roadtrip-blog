# Day 22

Went on a hike today through a slot canyon. The fossils and erosion formations are beautiful, and the canyon provides a nice bit of shade. Even if it didn't, the dry heat really is much more bearable than the same temperature in Ohio.

Junie has been a trooper. There were several points along the trail where she was scurrying up boulders and getting along like a seasond hiker. Who would have thought a hound dog would love the desert!

After the hike we took a nap at the campsite and drove to the actual Goblin Valley a few miles down the road. This is where they filmed the rock planet in Galaxy Quest. I can't get over both how otherworldly this place looks and also how you're allowed to just climb all over the rock formations.

After dinner (hot dogs) we set up a projector and played Mario Kart on the canyon wall and took some great pictures of the night sky. You can see the Milky Way! This is by far the best stargazing so far on the trip.
