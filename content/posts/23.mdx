# Day 23

It's sad to be leaving Goblin Valley, but a heat wave is coming in so it's time to move on. We stopped back in Green River for gas and got breakfast burritos at a place Chris recommended. They were **awesome**. And **HOT**. Rainey's was still warm when we finished driving for the day.

We made our way to Grand Junction to the cheapest camprgound that didn't have crappy Google reviews. This one was unstaffed on Sundays and the electrical hookup at our site was melted. Not a great start. With the temperature rising fast we had to find a different campground with hookups so Junie wouldn't cook in the heat. Luckily we found a KOA up the road.

KOA's are pretty nice! This one had a pool and a mini golf course. The free campsites we've stayed in up until now certainly have more character, but I see the appeal of staying here. That being said, it's a lot of retirees that sort of just stare at you as you walk by.

We made mac and cheese for dinner and gave Junie a good walk around. This might have been the hottest day yet.
