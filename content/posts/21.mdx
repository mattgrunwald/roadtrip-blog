# Day 21

On to Goblin Valley State Park. It's about an hour southwest of Green River. I got some work done before we met up with our friends Steph and Chris who brought their trailer and are boondocking with us. This place is surreal! The rock formations look like something out of a bad sci-fi movie set but they're completely real!

We found a secluded spot to boondock and set up camp. Out here Junie can basically roam free and play with Steph and Chris's dog Dod. Junie is a big old hound dog but she is loving the dry heat of the desert. Sometimes she will just go out and lay in the sun and we need to check on her to make sure she didn't just keel over. But no, she's just happy to be sleeping in the sunshine.

We grilled burgers for dinner. The bugs aren't too bad out here (but still present). It looked like a storm was about to roll in but it missed us. We've been pretty fortunate so far with the weather, all things considered. This landscape reminds me of reading Blood Meridian, although I don't think the outlaws in that story made it this far north.
