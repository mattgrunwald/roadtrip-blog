# Day 20

On to Green River. There is indeed a river, but it is not green. The name might also imply that it is in the forest somewhere, but that is also not true. We're fully in the desert now!

To be honest this whole town is a little worse for wear. Rainey and I decided to treat ourselves and stay the night in a motel with air conditioning. This place reminds me of the room you wake up in at the beginning of Portal 2 hundreds of years after the fall of civilization. The sign out front promised HBO and there is no HBO. As long as there's not bed bugs it's cool.

We got dinner from a local fast food place called Chow Hound and it was really good! I'm a sucker for a good burger and some curly fries.

Even though the carpets are damp and the room smells musty it is nice to sleep in a proper bed.
