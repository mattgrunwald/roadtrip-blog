# Day 1

Lots of driving, got a late start since we didn't pack the van before we went to Columbus. Our AC only works on defrost mode so we're not getting a lot of cold air in the back. We stopped every couple hours to let Junie out. She doesn't want to use the bathroom in unfamiliar places. That'll have to change!

Made it to the casino RV parking near the Iowa border. Looks like it's a staff parking lot too. Kind of creepy being the only RV there, but there are some trucks to keep us company. Mosquitos are in swarms. We made a delicious beef and rice dish.
