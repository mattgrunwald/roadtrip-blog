# Day 27

Got to see my friend Hasan today. He's leaning in to being a Denver transplant and was dressed like an REI mannequin. I hope you're reading this, Hasan. You dress like you kayak to work now.

We went to a local brewery that serves tea infused beers, then to a local fast food place that was AWESOME. More rain and more hail while we ate.

While we didn't get any Palisades peaches Rainey found a soda company that sells a Palisades peaches and cream soda, so Hasan and I went on a wild goose chase to find some and also some s'mores supplies. After two false leads we finally found some at a bar called Grandma's house. It was actually a pretty cozy place, but my grandma's house had a lot less beer. She drank whiskey sours.

After we got back to camp Hasan and I made a fire and cooked up some s'mores. Around 1am things were winding down and I walked Hasan to the restrooms so he wouldn't get lost. It was on the trail that I walked quite confidently into a ravine (where the trail was eroded by all the recent rain) and broke my foot. Let's just say you could hear it was broken. After all that Hasan still needed help finding the bathroom. Get a headlamp nest time you're at REI, Hasan.
