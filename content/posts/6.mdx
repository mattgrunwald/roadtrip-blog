# Day 6

Back in to Rapid City again to check our brakes. The mechanic said they were fine and we were on our way to Wyoming! The grasslands get hillier and the sky gets bigger and then when it gets windier you're in Wyoming.

We stayed in Douglas, which has a wonderful (and free) RV park with showers and plenty of space to walk the dog. It rained a little but none made it inside the van.
