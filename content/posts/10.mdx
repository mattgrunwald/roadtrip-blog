# Day 10

Headache this morning. I forgot we're at 9500 ft. and made the mistake of drinking two beers last night. You have to give yourself more time to acclimate!

Headed into "town" to do laundry and get work done and buy more souvenirs. We're lucky that this place has good reception (for verizon at least).

We found out there's a trail to the lake right by our campsite! It was beautiful watching the evening sun go behind the Tetons. It made all the months of planning and building, all the hours of driving seem worth it. Junie didn't like the smooth gravel beach. I think it hurts her feet to walk on it.
