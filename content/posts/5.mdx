# Day 5

I ate a breakfast sandwich from Hardee's and it might be the greasiest thing I've ever eaten 6/10. Stopped by a vet in Rapid City to get Junie some flea and tick meds. We forgot ours at home, doh! The vet said ticks are a big problem out here. That makes since since we're in the grasslands.

Made it into the black hills and past Mount Rushmore. It's kind of smaller that I thought it would be. I read on the internet that the site was sacred to native people and we manifested destiny all over that. Makes you feel guilty looking at it. The black hills are beautiful. We made camp at a rock climbing pulloff and ate steak. Mosquitos aren't so bad. Weather is finally cooling down.
