# Day 5

I ate a breakfast sandwich from Hardee's and it might be the greasiest thing I've ever eaten 4/10. Stopped by a vet in Rapid City to get Junie some flea and tick meds. We forgot ours at home, doh! The vet said ticks are a big problem out here. That makes since since we're in the grasslands.

Made it into the black hills and past Mount Rushmore. It's kind of smaller that I thought it would be. I read on the internet that the site was [sacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore#%22Six_Grandfathers%22_to_%22Mount_Rushmore%22) to native tribes and the pioneers manifested destiny all over that. Makes you feel guilty looking at it. The black hills are beautiful. We made camp at a rock climbing pulloff and ate steak. Mosquitos aren't so bad. Weather is finally cooling down.
