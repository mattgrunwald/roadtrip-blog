# Day 8

Drove through Wind River. The landscape is pretty bare. It feels like the government gave all the uninspiring land between two beautiful places to the native tribes. A cursory Google search tells me that's exactly what happened.

At the western edge of the res the rocks start to really get red. Reminds me a lot of Gypsum, CO.

Now we're headed up into the Tetons. You can feel the air get thinner and your ears pop. We made it to our campsite. Beautiful view, no cell reception, and a fresh bear print in the trail. Yikes!

Rainey saw a Moose yearling (still as big as a horse!) and it rained quite a bit.
