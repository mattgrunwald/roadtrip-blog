# Day 15

We drove back into the Flathead reservation to drive through a bison range. It's a very steep climb up some small mountains (or maybe just hills?) to see the ~400 bison that graze in the area. I guess any excess bison get donated to other reservations or possibly eaten? I should look into that more.

Bison are HUGE! It really makes you wonder why people would ever approach them in Yellowstone. The baby bison are cute though. The range had some great views.

After that we made bison burgers. Kind of morbid, but very delicious.
