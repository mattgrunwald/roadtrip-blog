# Day 3

Made it to the badlands! It's hard to miss since there's about five thousand billboards for Wall Drug along the way. We turned a corner in the highway and suddenly the green hills gave way to rock formations as well. Definitely drier out here. The view from our boondocking site is incredible! Tons of RVs, trucks, vans here. The road is rough getting in but somehow full size RVs are doing it.

To the west are mountains, to the east the badlands. You can see storms from miles away pummeling other places. We luckily had no rain.

Mosquitos still in swarms. My legs look icky.
